## Project Overview
The Wellbeing App is an Android application designed to promote mental, creative and emotional wellbeing by encouraging users, particularly teenagers and people, to engage in positive creative activities and tasks. It was created to address the growing need for tools that support mental health and foster a sense of community and keep creative and positive. The app allows users to create tasks related to good deeds or creative, earn points (wellpoints) for completing tasks, and connect with others who share similar interests in promoting wellbeing. The project is important to us as it aims to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals and communities. It was created in Feb 2024 and is available for download on Github. Application can be found [here](https://github.com/samirsuroshe18/WellBeing-app---Android-studio/releases/latest/). To use the app, simply download .apk file from the github and install on your android device, create an account, and start completing tasks to earn wellpoints.
